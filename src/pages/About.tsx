            Adrian's Story
          </h2>
          
          <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
            <p>
              Adrian didn't start as a trainer - he started as a carpenter, working on the tools like every 
              other tradie trying to make a living. He knows what it's like to be covered in sawdust at the 
              end of a long day, to deal with difficult site conditions, and to work for someone else's building 
              company while dreaming of running your own.
            </p>

            <p>
              After years working as a qualified carpenter on residential and commercial projects across Melbourne, 
              Adrian progressed into site management roles. He coordinated teams, managed projects from start to 
              finish, and gained deep knowledge of building regulations, compliance requirements, and quality 
              standards. But more importantly, he learned how buildings actually come together - not just the 
              theory from textbooks, but the practical reality of making it work on site.
            </p>

            <p>
              The turning point came when Adrian decided to get his building registration. Like many tradies, 
              he found the VBA licensing process confusing and intimidating. There was so much information to 
              absorb - building codes, Australian Standards, regulations, business knowledge - and not much 
              guidance on how to prepare properly. He passed his registration through determination and hard 
              work, eventually achieving both Domestic Builder (Unlimited) and Commercial (Low-Rise) licenses.
            </p>

            <p>
              After gaining his licenses, Adrian started noticing a pattern. Many experienced tradies with solid 
              practical skills were struggling with the registration process. Some failed multiple times not 
              because they lacked ability, but because they didn't know how to prepare effectively or what the 
              VBA was really looking for. Others gave up entirely, convinced they "weren't smart enough" - which 
              was never true.
            </p>

            <p>
              That's when Adrian decided to start training. He knew he could help tradies navigate the licensing 
              process because he'd been through it himself. He understood the challenges, the confusing parts, 
              and what made the difference between passing and failing. More than that, he believed experienced 
              tradies deserved to have their own building businesses, not spend their whole careers making 
              someone else rich.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over 10+ years and 500+ students later, Adrian has refined his teaching approach into something 
              uniquely effective: small classes, personalized attention, and a focus on understanding principles 
              rather than memorizing answers. His 95% success rate isn't accidental - it's the result of genuinely 
              caring about student success and refusing to take shortcuts in training. When you train with Adrian, 
              you're learning from someone who's been in your position and knows exactly how to help you succeed.
