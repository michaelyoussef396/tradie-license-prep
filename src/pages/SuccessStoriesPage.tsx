Rather than teaching everything from scratch, Adrian personalized the training to fill Fauzi's specific knowledge gaps. The small class size meant Fauzi could ask questions freely and get immediate feedback. The 600+ practice questions helped Fauzi master the test format, and the interview preparation built his confidence to articulate his practical experience professionally."

Five years later, his company turns over $15+ million annually and has built a reputation for exceptional quality and craftsmanship. Fauzi now employs multiple teams and manages several high-end residential projects simultaneously. His success demonstrates how proper licensing preparation can transform a tradie's career trajectory."
