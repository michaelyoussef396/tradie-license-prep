      question: "How long is the process before getting my license?",
      answer: "The training duration varies by program (6-13 weeks), but the complete process including application submission and VBA processing typically takes 3-6 months total. We help expedite this by ensuring your application is perfect before submission."
    },
    {
      question: "What experience do I need to enroll?",
      answer: "You need a minimum of 2 years practical trade experience in your field. You should be actively working or have recent experience in building/construction. We assess each applicant individually based on their background and circumstances."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you help with the VBA/BPC applications?",
      answer: "Yes! Complete application support is included in all our programs. We help you prepare your portfolio, gather technical references, complete all required documentation, and ensure everything is correct before submission. This significantly increases your chances of approval."
    },
    {
      question: "What qualifications do I need?",
      answer: "Requirements vary by license type. Generally, you need a relevant trade qualification (Certificate III or IV), minimum 2 years experience, technical references from registered builders, and evidence of your practical work. We'll assess your specific situation during consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "What does the VBA/BPC test involve?",
      answer: "The test covers building regulations, Australian Standards, building codes, construction techniques, site management, and business knowledge. Our programs include 450-600+ practice questions that mirror the actual test format. We also prepare you for the interview component."
    },
    {
      question: "What's your success rate?",
      answer: "95% of students who complete our programs successfully gain their registration. This high success rate is due to our personalized teaching approach, comprehensive preparation, and ensuring students are truly ready before attempting their licensing."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I fail the VBA test?",
      answer: "All our programs include a pass guarantee. If you complete the program, attempt your test, and don't pass, you can resit the training course for free. We're committed to your success and will work with you until you achieve your registration."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get a payment plan?",
      answer: "Yes! We offer flexible payment plans to make the investment more manageable. Contact us to discuss options that work for your financial situation. We believe cost shouldn't prevent good tradies from getting their license."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer online or in-person training?",
      answer: "We offer both! The Evening Builder Course and Comprehensive Program are face-to-face in Melbourne. The Private 1-on-1 Training is conducted via Zoom for maximum flexibility. All programs include online access to our testing platform."
    },
    {
      question: "How are classes different from online courses?",
      answer: "Our classes are live, interactive, and personalized. Unlike pre-recorded online courses, you get real-time feedback, can ask questions immediately, and receive coaching tailored to your individual strengths and weaknesses. Small class sizes (max 10) ensure personal attention."
    },
    {
      question: "What support do I get after the course?",
      answer: "Post-course support is included! We're available via email and phone to answer questions during your application process and even after you receive your license. Many students stay in touch and reach out when they need advice."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I switch courses after enrolling?",
      answer: "Yes, if you need to change programs due to work schedule or other reasons, we can discuss transferring to a different course format. We want to ensure you're in the program that works best for your situation."
